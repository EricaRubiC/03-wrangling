# January 29: Wrangling (variables)

The bulk of work on a typical data project is tidying (or wrangling, cleaning, munging): preparing the data for analysis. We'll spend two weeks on the topic. Our focus this week is on variables: creating, changing, renaming, reordering, and labeling. We'll learn that we can do a huge amount of this work within `mutate`. 

## Useful resources
- [Jenny Bryan's Chs 10-13](https://stat545.com/)
- [Hadley Wickham's Ch 15](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) is quite good on factors

## Materials for class
- Data: `water.csv`, DHS data from a region of Zimbabwe, children 6-15.
- Materials: an R script for reference (I'll hand out a hard copy)

## After class
- See the [PS2 repository](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/PS2). PS2 due Feb 12.
- I'll post a PS1 solution set early next week. Check here for link.
